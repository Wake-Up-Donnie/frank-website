                              We met with a couple of realtors before Frank, but we knew instantly that he was the right one for us.
                              He is honest, hands-on, patient and professional. He really helped to take the pressure off of us when taking the tour of the selling houses.
                              We have never felt forced to make an offer. Frank also walked us through every step of the negotiations, even helping us to find the lender and the remodeling guys.
                              If we have friends looking for homes or thinking about selling, definitely we will recommend Frank to them! "</p>

                              We met Frank at an open house in Carlsbad. I immediately felt he was friendly and without pressuring me was open to showing us around.
                              We felt so comfortable with him. He was so easy to get along with. He never made us feel like he was rushed and he was very professional and courteous to the listing agents as well.
                              He was very knowledgeable about the area and he tuned into who we were as people and what our likes and dislikes would be in a new home.
                              Frank guided us towards our best options in our price range.We found a great home in a short amount of time.
                              I really felt like he was willing to be inconvenienced to make sure we weren't stressed out, which is difficult when making a home purchase.
                              He combines the ability to execute the real estate transaction in a very timely fashion with warmth, courtesy and ease, that were worth his weight in gold!"</p>

                              when I say that we feel blessed to have had him as our realtor. Frank is professional, patient and very knowledgeable of his work.
                              He was able to explain things to me in a way that I can understand and make confident decisions. He is honest! As a Marine, honesty is my number one trait I look for in people.
                              I would be interested in a house and no matter how appealing it might look he would know the cons and give me the heads up.
                              I have and will continue to recommend Frank to all my friends and acquaintance due to his dedication, knowledge and professionalism.
                              Please, give him a strong handshake followed up with a hug from Ayu and I. If the future would present another business opportunity, Frank would be the man to call.

                              He was highly recommended to us by our friends Kathi and Wayne Kamins. They had purchased a home in Carlsbad shortly before we did.
                              We are so glad we were introduced to Frank. He handled our transaction impeccably. He always responded to our questions with speed and accuracy.
                              We never doubted that he would find out what we needed to know. He is a calm man which really helped when our negotiations became a bit heated.
                              We always felt he had our best interests at heart which is comforting during the stressful time of buying.
                              We will definitely utilize his services if we decide to sell in Lakeshore Gardens and we will also highly recommend him to anyone that requires a realtor."

                              I sent my husband from Missouri to help them pack up to move and he said Frank was always there anytime they called him.
                              He even helped my husband throw a few of the bigger things into the truck if he was around. With any other real estate agent, I believe the entire sale and move would have been far more difficult and longer process. Frank's a wonderful person."

                              <p>"This letter is to praise Frank Flores for an outstanding job as my realtor. He went out of his way to help me sell a condo in a very competitive and difficult market. Provided helpful critical advice! He marketed it so well that the first weekend I had close to 200 views on the Internet. He held at least 4 open houses to capture buyers. He spent a lot of extra time with the sale. It sold! I have lived in and sold five homes and in all that experience I have never encountered a better real estate agent than Frank! He is a dynamic salesman, agent and a great guy. Highly recommend him."

                            <p>"We met Frank Flores as we lived in the same neighborhood.We asked Frank if he would like to take us to look at a home that came up for sale. He did just a few hours later. After we looked Frank gave us the space we needed to talk it over. We decided to put in an offer with Franks help. The sellers came back with a counter.He helped us counter and we bought the home. Frank was so good about us calling him and talking to him anytime. He was also really good about finding information for us. He totally went above and beyond. He is professional and courteous. He sold our previous summer home and once again helped us with so many things. He has worked in our new community with quite a few of the homes. We thank him for all he has done for us. He made the move as seamless as possible."
